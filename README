A command-line calculator written in C.

To compile on Linux just run make.
For Windows, pick an IDE/Compiler of your choosing and compile with that.

Supports:

addition
substraction
multiplication
division
powers
sin()
cos()
tan()
abs()
brackets

The calculator works using Reverse-Polish Notation and the Shunting Yard algorithm.

Example input:

3+4*-(23/7^3)+sin(pi)*abs((-2^3)*e) 

== 2.731793


This program was written a long time ago and so some things
are written in a janky, weird/begginer kind of way. I will maybe
clean it up a bit later and add more functionality. Doubles are used for all
calculations.
